# Data Synthesis

You can download [the generated augmented data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19h0pHkEEwpk7i6VwrC7rknCAqKPCZXZ2/view?usp=sharing) `augment_mlm.txt` (used for training with the MLM loss) and `augment_data.txt` (without the MLM loss). We used tables from wikitable/`wikitable_dup1_row1.txt` and spider train set to synthesize the two files. The original augment code we used for synthesizing data from wikitable is `augment_wikitable.ipynb`.
